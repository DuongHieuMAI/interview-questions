# Some questions about problem solving skills

1. Common steps to solve an problem
- Find the root cause

Normally, we faced problem which is consequense of some bugs/issue inside. If we can determine exactly what is the reason causing prolem the quickly we come to final solution to eleminate it. System usally contains a lot of layers or components. Higher layer calls api exposed by by lower ones. Small conflicts or warning in lower layers can lead to bigger problem in higher level. On the other hand, bugs comes from a set of smaller issues.

- Look for solutions

If there is only one way to fix we have to do it right now. In case we have more than one solutions. We have to make decision and choose the best one by analysing its advantages and disadvantages. We collect information about each approach. In case we have no info about we can ask for help form other members of the team, ask some one who had faced it before or we have too many solutions we can ask team members to check it for you.

- Choose the final one (hardest step)

Once, we have enough information, we start to compare them, we can used some factor to evaluate the score of each solution. The factors or criteria can be client satisfaction, time-consuming, human resources, computing resources, budget, scalibilty, stablilty, ... 

Note that: 
- Depend on each project or situation, the priority of each factor/criteria.
- Dont use too many factors, it can lead to losing focus.
- Sort solutions from high to low, in case if one failed in implementation, next one is for backup. Alway have plan B

- Make your decision

Right after that, we lists / define all steps and put them in motion.

- Reflection

Always review all your action, verify if outcome is same as our desired.
World always changes, the best for today might not be good for later.

2. Situation that you solved a problem/ Challenges you faced

- Production server was shutdown incidentally
- Infinite loop of lambda function execution
- Some one expose AWS access key
