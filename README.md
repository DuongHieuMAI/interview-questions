# Interview Questions

Some common questions that software developers should prepare

## 1. Common questions

These questions used for most of developers from general concept of programming, testing and os architect

### 1.1 General programming

You might be asked about :

* Kinds of programming languages, Interpreted vs compiled languages
* Low-level languages vs High-level langues
* Heap vs Stack, Stack overflow, Heap Fragmentation
* Garbage Collection
* List some general concepts of programming languages
* Passing arguments as value or reference, and different
* OOP and its characteristics with example
* OODA and example
* Package, Module, Components, Library, Framework, Platform
* How to make your code better
* How to different senior vs junior developer

### 1.2 Concurrency programing

* Why is testing multithreaded/concurrent code so difficult?
* Multithreading vs Multiprocessing
* What is a race condition? Code an example, using whatever language you like.
* What is a deadlock? Would you be able to write some code that is affected by deadlocks?
* What is process starvation? If you need, let's review its definition.
* What is a wait free algorithm?

### 1.3 Code versioning

* What's a rebase
* How to modify commit that had been pushed
* Whatâ€™s is cherry pick

### 1.2 Testing

* Why test
* Kind of Test
* Mocking

### 1.3 Network

* OSI Model
* TCP VS UDP
* HTTP vs HTTPS
* HTTP 1 vs 2 vs 3
* MTTP vs Websocket
* MQTT vs RPC
* FPT vs SCP
* VPN

### 1.4 OS Concept (Optional)

* CPU core vs CPU Threads
* CPU vs GPU
* Linux distributions, core
* Real time OS
* Arm vs x86
* RISC vs CISC

## 2. Data structure and Algorithms

### 2.1 [Data Structure](./data-structure/README.md)

Array, Linked List, Hashtable, Binary Tree

## 2.2 [Algorithms](./algorithms/README.md)

* Complexity, Time complexity CPU complexity

## 2.3 Path Finding Algorithms

* Dijkstra
* A star

## 3. [Code Design](design/README.md)

* Design Pattern: Creational, Behavior, Structural
* Tell me about Inversion of Control and how it improves the design of code.
* Write a snippet of code violating the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Then, fix it.
* How would you deal with Dependency Hell?
* Mechanisms for achieving Separation of Concerns
* What's the difference between cohesion and coupling?
* What is refactoring useful for?
* Are comments in code useful? Some say they should be avoided as much as possible, and hopefully made unnecessary. Do you agree?
* What is the difference between design and architecture?
* In your opinion, why has Object-Oriented Design dominated the market for so many years?

## 4. Programming Language

### 4.1 [C++](./languages/c++/README.md)

### 4.2 [Python](./languages/python/README.md)

### 4.3 [Javascript](./languages/javascript/README.md)

### 4.4 [TypeScript](./languages/typescript/README.md)

## 5. [Backend Developer](./backend/README.md)

## 6. [Frontend Developer](./frontend/README.md)

## 7. [Mobile Developer](./mobile/README.md)

## 9. [Devops Developer](./devops/README.md)

## 10. [Software Architect](./architect/README.md)
